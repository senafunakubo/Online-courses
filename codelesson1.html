The building blocks of JavaScript make up every program and line of JavaScript.

  Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, JavaScript has its own building blocks.
  Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types.

  There are three essential data types to know for now,
  String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
  Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
  Boolean: This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.

  Let's review: a string is any grouping of words, a number's a number,
  and a boolean is a ghostly halloween costume. Or no, that's false! It's either true or false.


Modulus is to show you the remainder after you divide a number.
  if you divide 13 / 5, 5 goes into 13 two times, and there will be 3 remaining.
  A modulus, denoted by a %, would take 13 % 5 and return the remainder 3.


string interpolation is when you insert a variable into a string.


What best describes the variables in JavaScript?
 To allow the user to store or hold data.


 Variables
  Variables can hold any data type, like strings, numbers, and Booleans.
  They can also hold data types like arrays, functions and objects.


 Variables are useful in two ways:
 1. They allow us to use the same value over and over, without having to write a string or other data type over and over.
 2.  More importantly, we can assign variables different values that can be read and changed by the program
      without altering our code.
