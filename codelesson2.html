In programming, making decisions with code is called control flow.

Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=

To check if two things equal each other, we can use === (three equals in a row).
To check if two things do not equal each other, we can write !== (exclamation with two equals in a row).
Variables use one equals sign = to assign a value to a variable.
When you're comparing two variables, make sure to use three ===.

To say "both must be true," we can use &&.
To say "either can be true," we can use ||.
To say "I want to make sure this is the opposite of what it really is," we can use !.
To say "these should not be equal to each other," we can use !==.


To a computer, a switch statement and an if/else statement are the same,
 but a switch statement can be easier for other humans to read.
