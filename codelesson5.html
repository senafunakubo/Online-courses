The Document Object Model, commonly referred to as the 'DOM', is the term for elements in an HTML file.
Elements are any HTML code denoted by HTML tags, like <div>, <a>, or <p>. Let's use JavaScript to interact with the DOM.

We can select an HTML element with JavaScript by selecting its class attribute:
var header = document.getElementsByClassName('example-class-name');

This would find an element like this in the HTML:
<div class='example-class-name'> ... </div>

The link to jQuery needs to be above the link to the js/main.js file,
 which will give main.js access to the jQuery library.
