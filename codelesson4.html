Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists.
 These lists can store different data types and they are ordered,
  meaning the position of each list item is numbered by JavaScript.

  It is often convenient to know how many items are inside of an array.

  We can find this out by using one of an array's built in properties,
   called .length.
  We can attach this to any variable holding an array and it will return the number of items inside.


push() allows us to add items to the end of an array.
pop() is similar to push(), except that it deletes the last item of an array.


for loops, which let us loop a block of code a known amount of times.
while loops, which let us loop a block of code an unkown amount of times.
